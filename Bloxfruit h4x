    Bugs: 
        

    Caution:
        1. You will get kicked if you rapid fire for long enough. If you want to remove rapid fire then make:
            local changeVals = {
                Firemode = "Auto",
                MaxAmmo = math.huge,
                Firerate = 2000,
                Range = 2000000,
                ReloadTime = 0.1,
                Accuracy = 0.1,
                Speed = 250,
            }
        into this:
            local changeVals = {
                MaxAmmo = math.huge,
                Range = 2000000,
                ReloadTime = 0.1,
                Accuracy = 0.1,
                Speed = 250,
            }

    Unsure:
        1. Not sure if Firerate and Firemode even work. Removed for now. You can add it back in if you want.

    Side Notes:
        1. Infinite Stamina works weirdly. 3ds pls fix Connection.Function!!!!
        2. Silent Aim works, the hit marker just doesn't appear
